Robust Redis Lock [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crowdtap/robust-redis-lock.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/crowdtap/robust-redis-lock) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/robust-redis-lock.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/robust-redis-lock)
======

This is a robust redis lock that ensures that only one process can access a
critical section of code.

Unlike the many other implementations available, this implementation ensures
that an orphaned lock eventually expires in a safe (non-racy) manner. LUA scripting
made available in Redis 2.6 makes this possible.

Install
-------

```ruby
gem install robust-redis-lock
```
or add the following line to your Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'robust-redis-lock'
```
and run `bundle install`

Usage
-----

```ruby
  Redis::Lock.redis = Redis.new
  lock = Redis::Lock.new('lock_name')
  lock.lock do
    # Critical section
  end

  # Extend the lock by the timeout value. This will work regardless of whether
  # the lock has timed out or not.
  if lock.extend
    # The lock was successfully extended
  else
    # The lock was not successfully extended. This means that the lock was taken by
    # another process.
  end
```

Expired Locks
-------------

To get all expired locks:

```ruby
  Redis::Lock.expired.each do |lock|
    # Do something to clean up the lock
    lock.unlock
  end
```

If you have different groups of locks pass in the `:key_group` param when you
create the lock and when retrieving expired locks:

```ruby
  options = { :key_group  => 'a_key_group' }

  lock = Redis::Lock.new('lock_name', options)
  lock.lock

  Redis::Lock.expired(options).each do |lock|
    # Do something to clean up the lock
    lock.unlock
  end
```

Data
----

Data can be passed in at initialization time:

```ruby
  Redis::Lock.new('lock_name', "some data here")
```

If you need to pass in options as well:

```ruby
  Redis::Lock.new('lock_name', "some data here", :timeout => 5)
```

Also, data can be any object and will be serialized into YAML by default, if you
wish to use something else, refer to the [Advanced](#advanced) section below.

Advanced
--------

The following options can be passed into the lock method (default values are
listed):

```ruby
  Redis::Lock.new('lock_name', :redis      => Redis::Lock.redis,
                               :timeout    => 60, # seconds
                               :expire     => 60, # seconds
                               :sleep      => 0.1, # seconds,
                               :key_group  => 'default',
                               :serializer => YAML,
                               :namespace  => 'redis:lock')
```

If the lock has expired within the specified `:expire` value then the lock method
will return `:recovered`, otherwise it will return `true` if it has been acquired
or `false` if it could not be acquired.

The `serializer` option needs to support both `load` and `dump`.

Note that if a lock is recovered there is no guarantee that the other process
has died vs. that it is a slow running process. Therefore be very mindful of what
expiration value you set as a value too low can result in multiple processes
accessing the critical section. If you have recovered a lock you should cleanup
for the dead process if its possible to get into an unstable state.
